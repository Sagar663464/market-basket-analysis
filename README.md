# Market Basket Analysis

Market basket Analysis also known as association rule mining, is a popular technique used to analyze the purchasing behaviour and transactional data of their customers to recommend better products and thus increase sales. 
It is used in many retail businesses in order to improve their sales. Association rule and Apriori algorithm is used for this purpose. Both of these comes under unsupervised machine learning. It involves the data from a stationary shop with multiple products. So by analyzing the sales data, we'll be able to predict the best products to place with other products in the store.
